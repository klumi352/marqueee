                                <p>Founded by full-stack software developer and entrepreneur Gregory Rzeczko in 2022, Marquee Market is the world’s first NFT and crypto-based advertising platform. Leveraging amazing (and as-of-yet mostly untapped) Web3 capabilities, we aim to provide fellow crypto/NFT enthusiasts and investors with a revolutionary new way to maintain control and ownership of online ads.</p>
                                <p>As proponents of a decentralized, crowd-sourced online ecosystem, trust and transparency are very important to our team. Marquee Market is more than just a business – it’s a community collaborating towards a shared goal. That’s why we crowdsource all platform updates and provide expert support for all members. You can learn more about our platform, its current features, and the underlying technology that powers everything here.</p>

                                <h4>Founder Bio</h4>
                                <p>Born and raised in New Britain, Connecticut, Gregory Rzeczko has been interested in programming since the age of 15 – what started as a high school hobby quickly turned into an educational pursuit and ultimately a successful career. Now based in Brooklyn, Gregory has worked with major brands like Gucci, Nickelodeon, The Sundance Channel, Conde Nast, West Elm, and Madison Square Garden. During this time, he’s also founded several tech start-ups of his own. In recent years, he’s discovered a passion for crypto, NFTs, and a host of exciting new Web3 technologies.</p>

                                <p>Marquee Markets represents the convergence of these interests. Combining advanced IT skills, entrepreneurial instincts, and an unwavering belief in the power of Web3, Gregory has developed the world’s first NFT and crypto advertising platform. This new way of advertising enables businesses to maintain ownership and control of their ad (and that’s just scratching the surface of what’s possible in the future).</p>

                                <p>When he isn’t hard at work growing the Marquee Market community, Gregory’s interests include reading (history, religion/spirituality, rocket science, technology), working with AI/robotics, and making music – he’s set to release a 5-song hip-hop EP under the name Triple G Gregg Starski in the coming months.</p>
